# MNO-Black-Scholes

This is a python-developed web app that allows you to get real-time information about a number of commodities, choose a number of these to simulate a portfolio and estimate the returns of your investments in a certain number of months. This was developed as the final project for the course on Numeric Methods and Optimization in Spring 2019, ITAM University.

This app uses the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) API to retrieve the financial information. In order tu use it, you need to add your key in the `quandl.txt` file located in the root folder. Check this file for further instructions.
